Brother Printer SDK minimal integration example

Minimal sample app that uses the lastest Brother Mobile SDK to print a bitmap image in Android.
Ensure the printer is connected to the same network as the device (i.e., your phone). 

The app on the android emulator may not be able to find a network. 
This is likely because the virtual network setup by the Android emulator does not have access to networked printers.

In this case, you can test the printout by using your own Android phone in Developer mode.
